There are few cases when this happened,

###### 1. iCloud not sign-in to your device

Simply open Setting app, click the first item and sign in your iCloud account.

###### 2. Card Diary access to iCloud has been disabled.

For solving this issue. Open Setting app — Your Name — iCloud — Scroll down to find “**iCloud Drive**” and “**Card Diary**”. Make sure both of them are enabled.

 For extending iCloud Storage, open **iCloud Storage** page (Setting app — Your Name — iCloud — iCloud Storage), click “**Change Storage Plan**” or delete some data that you don’t want to use any more.

After iCloud storage increased, open Card Diary and click **iCloud auto sync** — **Sync Now** popup button. You will notice an “*Oops!*” alert popup. Click “**Continue**” to enable **iCloud auto sync** again. If this step no been done, for the data safety reason, Card Diary wouldn’t restart to do iCloud auto sync automatically.
